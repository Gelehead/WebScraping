# WebScraping
Here are two side projects:
 - "pokemon move finder", the more polished of the two
 - "oath card collector", the one with the most potential

They have been made during 2024 summer, around June. They aim to merge skills and passion, letting me experiment with BeautifulSoup, Pandas and requests as libraries.

## PKMN Move Finder
As the title suggests, it helps find pokemon moves. 
The program returns a list of pokemons having in common your selected moves

For example, after entering 'Yawn' and 'Amnesia', we have as a result : 

{'Numel', 'Slaking', 'Slakoth', 'Snorlax', 'Magcargo', 'Slowking', 'Clodsire', 'Psyduck', 'Golduck', 'Torkoal', 'Cetitan', 'Swalot', 'Dunsparce', 'Gastrodon', 'Uxie', 'Slowbro', 'Quagsire', 'Dudunsparce', 'Gulpin', 'Wooper', 'Slugma', 'Hippowdon', 'Mudkip', 'Slowpoke', 'Cetoddle', 'Shellos', 'Hippopotas', 'Camerupt'}

So all the pokemons that share those two moves


### TODO 
still have to make an edge case when the user enters an invalid move name


### Thanks
thanks to the devs and moderator of the pokemon db website for its amazing structure, making it really easy to navigate around, browsing and selecting pokemons


## Oath cards collector
As the second project, it was made way faster than the previous one, and I wanted to create a replica of the board game "Oath" as a web project, which is still being worked on, only a bit slower than I would like to.

### TODO
